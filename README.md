#MAEL Gen

[See the website](https://sites.google.com/lvh.edu.ni/mael/projet-mael)

##1- Purpose
Cross-platform desktop application (Linux, MacOS, and Windows) that allows teachers to easily create QR codes containing text for their students to listen to. 
They can integrate them into their various teaching materials, adding an audio dimension to their paper documents.

QR codes will be scanned by students using the MAEL Scan app (available on Android and coming soon to iOS).

→ Already in operation for over two years.

##2- Functions
- **Read mode**: displays and reads aloud the text contained in the QR code.
- **Dictation mode**: does not display but reads aloud the text contained in the QR code.
- **Spell mode**: reads aloud each letter of the text contained in the QR code.
- **MP3 playback**: File from Google Drive

##3- Upcoming features
1- **Dictation mode** → Plans to add punctuation reading aloud

2- **Spell mode** → Add languages. Currently, only FR, EN, and ES are available

3- **MP3 playback** → Creation of a MAEL Cloud with fewer limitations than Google Drive.

4- Replacing TKinter with **TTKBootstrap**

5- **Move the mode change access buttons** from the “Settings” menu to the slider instead.
